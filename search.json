    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to Biology Experimental Design and analysis, also known as BEDA. This book contains all of the information you need to navigate your way around the practicals for this unit. It also contains some additional ‘housekeeping’ information that you may find useful.\nMany students think of BEDA as yet another statistics unit. This is not quite true. Unlike most other statistical units, BEDA focuses on the practical aspects of data analysis. We assume that you already have a basic understanding of statistical concepts, and we build on that knowledge, focusing on the how and why of statistical methods:\nImportantly, attending labs is crucial to your learning as most of the data we use are collected by you – please do not skip any of them!\nPlease read all the sections before the practicals as they contain important housekeeping information.",

We expect most of you to be familiar with the basic statistical techniques, but we will go through the standard concepts and unify them under a linear modelling framework. In addition we introduce to you the concept of study design and how it influences the results of your analysis.\nModule 2: led by Clare McArthur, critically assesses study designs that have already been done. Using real data examples, we will look at how variations in study design can influence the results. You will notice that the concepts from Module 1 are applicable to more complex models. You will also start working on Report 1 which requires you to design and analyse an experiment.\nModule 3: led by Mathew Crowther, focuses on the application of statistical techniques to real-world data that is often complex and messy – and how to deal with it using multivariate techniques. You will start working on Report 2 which requires you to collect and analyse data from your environment, rather than a controlled experiment.",

    "section": "Exercise 2 – introduction to models",
    "text": "Exercise 2 – introduction to models\nBackground\nOne important aspect of study design is the ability to model data. One way to do it is by using graphical plots, which essentially capture the essence of a study design in a visual form. In this exercise, we will introduce you to the concept of modeling data and get you thinking about how to use models to assist in experimental design and analysis.\nWhat is a model?\nA model is a simplified representation of a complex system. In the context of data analysis, a model is a way to represent a dataset that allows us to shape testable hypotheses or make predictions about the data. Models can be simple or complex, depending on the data and the research question.\nEventually, you will be presenting what we call an empirical model, which looks like a mathematical equation, but actually does not really require any mathematical knowledge to understand.\nAn example of an empirical model is this:\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\epsilon\nWhich roughly translates to “the value of y is equal to the value of x_1 times a constant, plus some error and an initial constant.”\nThe above may look intimidating, but we can simplify it by thinking of it as a simple relationship, rather than an equation, therefore forming:\ny \\sim x_1\nAnd so if y is weight and x_1 is age, then it is interpreted as:\n\\text{weight} \\sim \\text{age}\nWhich translates to “the weight of an object is influenced by its age”.\nPlots as models\nFor now, we will focus on graphical models. These are plots, but essentially they are models since they can represent a relationship between two or more variables. Using the same example as above, we can plot the weight of a species of animal against its age and height to see if there is a relationship between them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, how you consider your variables can drastically change the type of plot and model used for data analysis. For example, consider the same relationship as above, but plotted differently:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice how both plots explain the same kind of relationship, but their interpretation and the type of model used are different. This is the essence of study design and data analysis – the model you select can drastically change the data and results you get, and planning for it is crucial to the success of your study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you can plot it, you are already modelling it!\n\n\nTasks\nPreparation\n\nMS Excel or similar: to read the files\nMS Word, Google Docs or similar: to write your answers\nData: penguins.csv and possum.xlsx\nInstructions\n\n\nStep 1. Download and explore the data: penguins.csv and possum.xlsx.\n\nStep 2. Identify variables from the data to formulate models. You do no need to analyse the data, neither do you need to explore it in detail. The focus is on understanding the variables and how they can be modelled. Use the variables to consider the following models:\n\nHistogram to show the distribution of a variable\nScatterplot to show the relationship between two variables\nBoxplot to compare two or more groups\nBarplot to compare two or more groups, but with error bars. Consider what the error bars represent.\n\n\n\nStep 3. For plots that compare two variables or more, consider how you could alter the way you collect data to use a different model. Also consider this: is the alteration logical and feasible?\n\nStep 4. These plots are often associated with specific empirical models and statistical analyses, which we will cover in the upcoming weeks. Can you predict what sort of statistical model you would use to analyse the data in Step 1 and Step 2? It is ok if you do not know most of the answers to this question yet. Discuss this with your peers and demonstrators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowse the possum data in MS Excel. Let’s consider a model of how the weight of a possum changes with age.\n\nIdentify the variables: what type of variables are they? Are they continuous, categorical or something else? With that in mind, draw the plot(s) that you think will help you interpret the data. Weight is continuous and age is categorical, so a boxplot would be a good start.\n\nDifferent model: Age data to be collected in years, rather than categories. This would allow us to use a scatterplot to model the data. But it may not be possible to age possums as we do not know their birth dates, so this may not be feasible.\n\nThe first model is probably a two-sample t-test, while the second model could be a linear regression.\n\nNotice that in the example above, you have not performed any data analysis. You are simply considering how to interpret the data, which is an important step in study design. This helps you determine the type of data you need to collect and how to analyse it.\nIf you look at the data closely, there is only one juvenile possum in the dataset, so you would not have been able to analyse this data anyway!",

    "text": "Exercise 1 – Modelling from observations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRemember, the best models are often the simplest. Focus on logical and critical thinking when designing your study. The sampling design is usually more important than the statistical model. Keep this in mind as you work through the exercise!\n\n\nBackground\nImages are commonly used to quantify patterns in biology, from molecules to ecosystems. In ecology, for instance, satellite images and aerial photographs are used in some ecological studies to quantify patterns of distribution and abundances of animals and plants across habitats.\nHere you will explore experimental design, model formulation and data analysis by collecting data from available images and use both evidence and logic to work out how to explain the patterns you observe.\nWork in groups – You will be working in groups of 3-4 students. Your task is to observe the images provided and formulate a model that explains the patterns you observe. You will then create a study design that will allow you to test your model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDo not proceed to Exercise 2 until you have completed this exercise, and a Demonstrator has sighted your study design.\n\n\nGetting started\nYou are provided with random, representative, replicate photographs of a common marine habitat that spans &gt; 8,000 km of the Great Southern Reef, i.e. the coastline along the bottom half of Australia – intertidal rocky shores (Fig 1).\nAccess the images, including background information, here (note: link will open in a new window/tab).\nUsing these images and the species identification guide, formulate a model and a (testable) hypothesis. You will then think about what data you need to collect to test your hypothesis. See below for further details.\nStudy design\nYou should have a clear model in mind before collecting data. The model determines your sampling strategy and the type of data you need. Consider the following:\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of your model? Think about the biological question you are trying to answer, and the kinds of data you need to collect to answer it.\nThink of how you would collect data to test your model. What are the variables you need to measure? How would you measure them?\nScrutinise your images with the model in mind. Can the data be collected representatively from the images? Are there issues of replication or confounding variables that you need to consider?\nDo you have the time and resources to complete the study in the time frame provided, i.e. by the end of next week?\nWhat is your backup plan if data assumptions are not met?\n\nWhile you may not have all the answers right away, it’s important to have a rough idea of what you want to do, such as comparing groups, measuring correlation, or creating a linear model.\n\n\nThe Great Southern Reef. © 2021 California Academy of Sciences.\n\nTask\nA Google Docs page will be shared with you to record your responses. Please make sure that all group members have access to this document. On the document, claim a page and write your group name and the title of your project.\nThen, address your study design by answering the following questions:\n\n\nModel and hypothesis: What is your model and hypothesis? What are you trying to test and how will you test it? What would the plot look like?\n\nVariables: What are the variables you need to measure? What types of variables are they (e.g. continuous, categorical)?\n\nData collection: How would you collect data to test your model? What are the potential issues you need to consider?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this example will probably not be relevant to your images, but it should give you an idea of what is expected.\n\n\nProject title: Does rock size influence the number of species that can be found on a rocky shore?\n\nGroup name: Schist happens\n\n\n\nModel and hypothesis:\n\nWe hypothesise that the number of species on the rocky shore is positively correlated with the size of the rocks.\nWe will model the relationship between the number of species and the size of the rocks using a linear model.\nThe plot is expected to be a scatter plot with the number of species on the y-axis and the size of the rocks on the x-axis.\n\n\n\nVariables:\n\nWe need to measure the number of species and the size of the rocks.\nNumber of species is an integer variable.\nSize of the rocks is continuous variable.\n\n\n\nData collection:\n\nFor each image, we will divide it into a 10x10 grid.\n3 random quadrats will be selected from each grid.\nThe size of all visible rocks will be measured in each quadrat.\nThe number of unique species in each quadrat will also be counted.\nWe will then calculate the average size of rocks and the average number of species for each image to minimise pseudoreplication.\nPossible confounding could arise from the presence of seaweed, which could affect the number of species present.\nIf the number of species is too high to count, we will group species into functional groups and count the number of functional groups instead.\n\n\n\nBackup plan:\n\nIf the assumptions of the linear model are not met, we will transform the data, otherwise we will attempt a non-linear model.",

You can use any spreadsheet software you like (e.g. Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers).

    "text": "Exercise 2 – Data analysis\n\nFitting a model to data\nRecall that you have an empirical model e.g. y ~ x. You will need to use an appropriate statistical model to fit this relationship to your data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou should already know what model you are fitting to your data as it it part of your study design!\n\n\n\n\nChecking assumptions\nAssumptions need to be checked as they basically tell you whether the model you have fitted is appropriate for your data. If the assumptions are not met, you may need to transform your data or use a different model.\nCommon assumptions include:\n\nNormality (of residuals)\nHomogeneity of variance\nIndependence of observations\n\nWe recommend looking at residual plots, rather than formal tests of assumptions. Formal tests of assumptions can be overly sensitive to large sample sizes and can lead to you rejecting a model that is actually appropriate for your data.\nWhat to do if assumptions are not met? This is a common problem in data analysis, and interestingly, it is not always a problem. Provided that you have ensured that your data is representative of the population you are interested in, violations of normality can actually be ignored in many cases, although you should still report them. A larger problem is homogeneity of variance.\nNevertheless, you get to decide on what to do here to avoid violation of assumptions. The first step would be to try and transform your data. If this does not work, you will need to use a different model or a non-parametric equivalent of the model you are using.\n\n\nStatistical testing\nRunning the statistical test is probably the least eventful part of the analytical workflow and will take you a few seconds regardless of the software you are using. Make sure that you record the software used and the specific statistical technique selected such that the analysis is reproducible.\n\n\nInterpretation\nInterpreting the output of a statistical test is a skill that takes time to develop. You will need to be able to:\n\nUnderstand the important parts of the output e.g. F-statistic, p-value, degrees of freedom, etc.\nExplain what the output means in the context of your data.\nExplain what the output means in the context of your research question.\n\nYour lectures and this week’s workshop will help you develop these skills.",

    "text": "Preamble\nI think one of the most exciting things about being a biologist is discovering how the world works. One skill that helps me do so, is knowing how to set up an experiment to test my ideas about the world. You may need to overcome that initial learning hump, but if you persist, you will have a skill at your fingertips that will stand you in really good stead for the future. It doesn’t matter whether you intend to go on in research or not - knowing what makes good research and good evidence is important in so many walks of life.\nMy message is: whether you are doing this unit just because you have to, or because you are interested – take heart! I never did anything much more complicated than a t – test even during my PhD. But now I LOVE designing experiments and grappling with data. It can be frustrating at first, especially if you are time-poor and just want to get the job done. It can be infuriating. It can also be fun (yes – fun!). Most of all it’s incredibly satisfying and extraordinarily useful. So, persist, try your best, and ask for help if you need it.\nPlease remember we want you to learn this stuff.\nNo question you ask is EVER silly! So ask for help any time. We do expect you to have a go at telling us what you think the answer is. This helps us understand what you get and what you don’t get, and so helps us help you.\nWe don’t judge you by the questions you ask, but by what you end up learning.",

Ensure your design can be analysed using the stats you are familiar with (e.g. from Januar’s and Clare’s lectures, and Module 1 practicals). Draw a graph of how you expect your data to look (refer to Clare’s lectures). Decide what stats analysis is appropriate and why (refer to Clare’s lectures). If you can’t work this out, you are not ready to run your experiment.\nDraft your data sheets: as a group, draft your data sheets for data collection (you may need to modify after your pilot study). This will ensure you collect all the data you should and collect it all in the same way.\nWork out what equipment you’ll need: decide equipment you need to do the research based around what we can supply you. Consult Clare, technical staff and/or demonstrators then make a list.\n\nFor some projects, you will be able to take gear home straight away to run a pilot study.\nFor others, you need to plan now and pick up gear in consultation with the technical staff. When contacting the tech staff, ensure you state your name and day, group number and project, e.g. BIOL2022 WED 2 to 4pm, Group 7 birds, Joe Blogs.\n\nPlan your pilot study in class and run it before Week 5 practical session: this will help you refine your main experiment.

Preferably, have this done before this practical session.\nMetadata: include a metadata worksheet that summarises important information referring to your data, such as:\n\nnames of group members\nthe dates the experiment was run\nsites where you collected data\nresponse (i.e. dependent) variables and their units of measurement,\nexplanatory (i.e. independent) variables, such as treatments (and the levels within each treatment) and any continuous variables\nanything to help you understand your project and data if you were to publish it for the world to see and understand, e.g. what the columns in your data sheet mean\n\nPlot, analyse and interpret: in the remaining practical time (at least an hour) using your group’s data set, each group member should individually learn to use Excel and R or SPSS to plot your data, run appropriate statistical analyses and interpret your results. You need to think about what stats results you need in the results section of your written report. Fantastic if you can complete this task by the end of week 7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is okay to work with other group members to plot and run the tests.

Does the amount of previous damage matter?\nBackground: Many plants have plant secondary metabolites (PSMs), which often play a role in defence against herbivores. In some plant species, PSMs can be induced (levels increase) after damage from herbivores chewing on leaves. This change can take place within a day, affecting subsequent leaf damage by herbivores, and result in less subsequent damage. Is the evidence consistent with this idea in tomatoes?\nVariation: If you want to answer a more complicated question, you could ask whether the amount of initial damage (a little versus lots?) affects the outcome.",

    "text": "Animal Ethics requirements for Projects on birds\nIf you sign up to these projects, you must follow the animal ethics requirements as approved by the University of Sydney Animal Ethics Committee: Project “Ecology teaching – bird surveys”. Project Number: 2022/2148.\nYou may collect data for up to 10 visits per site over a 2 to 4 week period. For the bird survey, you may observe birds, count them and identify each to species if you can, using binoculars where needed. You may observe birds at a site for up to ~ one hour per visit, but must not interfere with nor handle the birds.\nAt a given site, the surveyor (1 to 5 students per site) will find a suitable location to observe birds. They will stand or sit still for 15 to 30 minutes per location and count the birds they can see in their site. They may need to move to up to five other locations per site if they have difficulty identifying the birds from afar. The number of each species will be recorded with reference to bird guides, and a total of about one hour will be spent at each site per observation period.\nDepending on your project, you may quantify other data, such as vegetation assessments and size of any habitat types including water bodies, at each site, enabling a test of the factors affecting bird abundance and species diversity.\nObservers will remain far enough from birds that the birds are not visibly affected by them (i.e. do not alter their behaviour, either by moving away or by altering what they are doing). This avoids any potential impact of the observer on time or energy budgets of the birds (as described in Bateman et al. 2011).\nReference: Bateman, P. W., and P. A. Fleming. 2011. Who are you looking at? Hadeda ibises use direction of gaze, head orientation and approach speed in their risk assessment of a potential predator. Journal of Zoology 285:316-323.\n\nConditions of bird project approval:\n\nYou must use the approved monitoring sheet “Bird survey monitoring sheet.xls” which will be provided to you. You may add additional columns or have additional sheets, as you decide, appropriate to your study.\nYou must take photos of the fieldwork sites and the observers watching the birds (i.e. to see the relative locations of the observers to the birds).\nBy the end of Week 9, you must post on Canvas:\n\nA complete legible copy of the final monitoring sheets from (1)\nA summary of the total number of (i) native birds, (ii) invasive birds hence (iii) all birds you counted at each site and across all sites over the course of your project, and a list of the sites you monitored, with GPS coordinates.\nClearly and informatively labelled photos from (2).\n\nInjured birds: In the very unlikely event that birds are found injured on site: you must:\n\nseek advice from Clare McArthur (clare.mcarthur@sydney.edu.au, subject heading: “BIOL2022 URGENT - bird project”) or other academic in the unit of study,\nwhile ensuring your own safety first, if necessary arrange to appropriately transport seriously injured animals to the nearest veterinarian for treatment, AND\nyou must notify Clare McArthur by email within 24h, summarising what has occurred (this will be reported as an adverse event to the Animal Ethics Committee even if you played no part in the injury).",

They will not know if you are referring to one thing or several. DO: pick one name for a variable and stick to it.\nTake the reader by the hand. DO NOT assume they know what you know. DO lead them through your work and explain things as you go along. Justify your decisions. Think like a reviewer: what will they want to know? Pre-empt it by being transparent, explaining what you decided to do and why.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere will generally be more references in the intro than the discussion. The focus of the intro is on: what do we know already?\nReferences are used to provide background of the research area – do not just list references on a topic. Instead, use them to summarise what we know and understand as a result of these studies. Make it clear what we know from (a) empirical evidence (with examples, i.e. do we know it for lots of individuals/species/contexts/ecosystems or whatever? which? Just one? which?) OR (b) what we think we know (conceptual hypotheses).\n\n\n\nSuggested Paragraph 1:\n\nIntroduce the broad topic\nDescribe what research has been done on this topic\n\n\n\nSuggested Paragraph 2:\n\nStart to narrow down what area in this topic your paper will be covering  Introduce gaps in knowledge  Possibly describe issues with previous studies (that your paper will address)\nThis information can show the importance of your paper\n\n\n\nSuggested Paragraph 3 to 5:\n\nSpecifically describe what your paper will investigate\nState your aims and hypotheses/predictions. These should follow and funnel down from your background. If you put your hand over your aims, you should be able to guess them from the background you provide above\nBriefly describe how you investigated the topic\nState any predictions with information to backup these predictions\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe focus is now on what you found, what it means and so how you have advanced our state of knowledge & understanding as a result of what you have done.\nTherefore: generally fewer references in the discussion than the introduction\nReferences should be used to support your idea or relate your conclusions/results to previous studies\nThe following paragraph order makes sense but you can obviously increase or decrease the number of paragraphs depending on the context and size of your study.\n\n\n\nSuggested Paragraph 1:\n\nState any broad results that you found\nProvide evidence from your results that enabled you to come to that conclusion\nCompare the result to any predictions you made or previous studies\n\n\n\nSuggested Paragraph 2 to 4:\n\nState more detailed results (e.g. species specific results if dealing with multiple species)\nProvide evidence from your results that enabled you to come to that conclusion\nCompare the result to any predictions made or previous studies\n\n\n\nSuggested Paragraph 5:\n\nLimitations of your study\n\nNo study can answer everything and every study is limited in some way in what is achieves! Don’t worry! That’s life!\nDon’t dwell on this or go too much in depth – especially do not be apologetic.\nBe positive: just outline the boundaries of the conclusions that can be made with your results\n\nSuggested direction of future studies i.e. what could be done next to move forward in our understanding and/or resolving any unanswered questions given what you have now discovered – again keep this brief\n\n\n\nSuggested Paragraph 6:\n\nWhat are the implications of your study for your field of research\nDescribe what this information can affect or be used for (e.g. management decisions)\n\n\n\nSuggested Paragraph 7:\n\nYou do not need a concluding paragraph – but if you do, it is not just a summary.\nIt should be more big picture stuff but take care: it should not state something that could have been said whether or not you had done your study. It must rest on your study.",

    "text": "Background\nMultivariate analyses are becoming more prevalent in biology as tools performing the necessary complex computations become more accessible. As the lectures outline, this accessibility has given rise to the uncritical use of methods leading to inappropriate analyses being used to deal with multivariate data sets. At the very least, biologists need to have a working understanding of how to choose appropriate tests and how to identify when someone has chosen poorly.\nSome of the more common uses of multivariate approaches permit us to describe complex patterns simply, identify patterns of groupings in complex data sets and test statistical hypotheses using multivariate datasets.\nIn this section of the unit, you will be able to practice performing these multivariate techniques using sample data sets. Then you need to demonstrate your ability to use these multivariate methods to analyse data that you will collect in groups to highlight the nuances of different techniques. Whilst best practice normally dictates that we would normally decide on appropriate tests before we collect our data, this task will enable us to explore options for analysis more effectively.",

In addition, you will be comparing your lecturer perceptions between preferred systems (marine, freshwater or terrestrial), preferred taxon (animals or plants) and gender (male or female) using conventional univariate approaches (t-tests/ANOVAs). To perform these univariate approaches, make sure that you not only create the principal components (PCs) but also save the scores (see below) for each component.\nThe process in SPSS is listed below. R instructions are given on Canvas in an R Studio file\n\n1. Running the PCA\n\nImport your lecturer data from excel into SPSS. On the command bar, click Analyze, Dimension Reduction, Factor. Move the variables of interest into the Variables Box.\nClick Descriptives and then check Initial Solution, Coefficients, and KMO and Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity. Click Continue.\nClick Extraction and then select Correlation Matrix, Unrotated Factor Solution, Scree Plot, and Eigenvalues Over 1. Click Continue.\nClick Rotation. Select Varimax and Rotated Solution. Click Continue.\nClick Scores and select Save Scores.\nClick Options. Select Exclude Cases Listwise and Sorted By Size. Click Continue.\nClick OK, and SPSS completes the Principal Components Analysis.\nTake a good look at the correlation matrix. The PCA captures the essence of the correlations in this matrix. If there are any variables that are not correlated with the other variables, you might as well delete them prior to the PCA. Since we are using PCA to reduce the set of variables to a smaller set of components to be used in additional analyses, you can always reintroduce the unique variables (i.e. those not correlated with other variables) at that time.\nBartlett’s Test of Sphericity, can be used to test the null hypothesis that our sample was randomly drawn from a population in which the correlation matrix was an identity matrix (a matrix full of zeros, except, for ones on the main diagonal). An identity matrix would occur only if each variable only correlated with itself and not any other variable. However, it is easier and more interpretable if you look at your data instead.\n\n\n\n2. Interpreting the PCA\nYou need to:\n\nLook at the correlation matrix.\nExamine the scree plot and determine how many PCs you can identify (eigenvalues &gt;1, Kaiser’s Criterion).\nEstablish a meaningful name for each component based on the loadings for individual variables in the rotated solutions.\n\n\n\n3. After the PCA\nExamine whether gender, system biases (marine v. terrestrial) and taxon (animal v. plant) biases may affect the perceptions of biology lecturers. You will need to code the columns for each factor (i.e. males = 0, females = 1) for SPSS to perform its standard one-way ANOVAs or t-tests.\nQuestions to consider:\n\nDo males and females perceive lecturer qualities the same way?\nDo botanists and zoologists perceive lecturer qualities the same way?\nDo marine and terrestrial folk perceive lecturer qualities the same way?",

In groups, you will generate your own multivariate datasets using non-biological model systems like cars and the car parks they inhabit, gargoyles and the buildings they live on, or beer types and the type of drinking establishment in which they congregate.\n\n\nAn example of a non-biological model system\nCars have proven a useful vehicle for understanding analytical techniques in ecology (Gaston et al. 1993) and they are a good model system for our needs. We can study the assemblages of different cars (as analogues of “species”) that inhabit different suburbs and look at some characteristics of their car parks (as analogues of “habitat use”). See the sample proforma attached illustrating how we can generate a multivariate system with testable hypotheses using car assemblages and the car parks they inhabit as an example.\n\n\nGroups\nIn groups, you will need to create your own non-biological multivariate system. Using this model system, come up with several (2 to 3) multivariate hypotheses relating to the assemblages of “species” in different “treatments” (2 factor design is encouraged) and the “habitat variables” that may be influencing “habitat use”. Make sure that your treatments are adequately replicated (you will need at least 3 of each treatment). You will need to make a sampling technique in your groups that will allow you to collect the data necessary to test your hypotheses. You should also decide who will co-ordinate the data preparation.\nEach group will present a short (&lt;5 min) presentation during the practical session in Week 11 (week 2 of the pracs). For this, you will have a short powerpoint presentation containing the following information. This is compulsory for this unit: This enables staff to give feedback so you can collect the appropriate data for analyses in the next 2 weeks. Note this feedback is meant to be friendly, we are not upset or angry if we point out flaws in your design.\n\nan introduction to your system (model species and your treatments);\nyour hypotheses (there should be 2 or 3);\na description of your taxonomy;\nyour sampling design (including information on sampling effort and sample sizes);\nthe habitat variables you will be measuring at each site (and how you will measure them);\na map of your sites",

This is a group assessment so only one member of your group needs submit the data file for the whole group. This is worth 5% of your assessment, with near perfect datasets getting the full 5%. It is a group assessment, so Special Considerations, Simple Extensions and Academic Plans do not apply.\nFor the final assessment, each student will write a short report. The emphasis on the report will be on the methods and results sections, reflected in the attached marking scheme. You do not have to use your imagination in regard to references/ reasons for the study, but are welcome to. You do need to include your hypotheses in the Introduction section.\nThe report will consider the work you did and the ways you analysed it. It must be no longer than four single-spaced typed pages (not including the cover sheet, a title page with the abstract or any pages of references, figures and tables) and will be in the form of a manuscript suitable for submission to Austral Ecology. This report will focus on the methods you used, in particular how you describe your analyses, the type(s) of data you collected and how you present your results.\nYour report is due at 11:59pm on Sunday, before STUVAC. We hope to return reports with summative feedback a week later. Your report should be submitted electronically, anonymously (use your SID for identification) through Canvas.\nDo not plagiarise or copy from others:\n\nCheck the website http://sydney.edu.au/students/academic-integrity.html for access to the policies and codes covering academic honesty and conduct at the University\nWe will take marks off if you have obviously used ChatGPT.

Press OK.\nIf appropriate, return to transformed data set and go to Analyse and then SIMPER. Select appropriate factor and click OK.\nSave result(s) to a file.\n\n\n\nANOSIM\nAs an alternative to PERMANOVA, many studies will test differences between treatments using Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM). Unlike PERMANOVA which can be used for multi-factorial designs, ANOSIM is best used for simple one-factor analyses. PERMANOVA and ANOSIM will generate the same (or very similar results) for one-factor analyses.\n\nTo perform an ANOSIM\nReturn to resemblance matrix, go to Analyse then to ANOSIM, select appropriate factor which you added before.\nSignificance level in % in ANOSIM becomes probability if divided by 100. e.g. 0.2 ÷ 100 = 0.002 = P (in this case P &lt; 0.05). If ‘Significance level of sample statistic’ in ‘Global Test’ section of the output is more than 5 (which is &gt; 0.05), than there is no significant difference among any of the treatments even if ‘Pairwise Tests’ section has significant differences between pairs of particular treatments. ANOSIM results are presented as: (P = 0.076, Global R = 0.148, 999 permutations) where P is a global significance level.",

    "text": "For next week\nOur first steps involve organizing the data so that we can get it into our analytical software (SPSS, PRIMER, R etc,) and generating summary statistics and figures. Different analytical software requires slightly different formats but there are usually some generalities that apply across programs.\nFor the start of next week’s practical each group will need to have collated their group data into three spreadsheets; These spreadsheets will be marked out of 5 by demonstrators.\n\nHabitat data: an SPSS or R ready excel file with sites as rows and habitat variables as columns (see below)\nAssemblage/Community data: a PRIMER or R ready excel file with species ID as rows and sites as columns (see below)\nSummary statistics: additional excel files as above (1 and 2) but with summary statistics (numbers of spp., individuals, habitat variables etc.) calculated for your data. This may be done on a site specific or treatment specific basis depending on your question.\n\n\n1. Your habitat data for PCA\nHabitat data – You will need to enter your data on habitat characteristics into SPSS or R for analysis next week. Make sure you are familiar with how to organise it for SPSS. Every site needs its own row where every habitat variable measured is listed, i.e. every site assessment has an independent row. If you have treatments you need to include a column labeling those treatments too (in addition to “site name”).\n\n\n2. Organising and entering assemblage data for PRIMER\nAssemblage/Community data – You will need to generate your spp*site matrix into a PRIMER ready file so that we are ready to analyse your data at the labs next week. These will take the form of a spreadsheet with a single column identifying species (unique species identifiers are fine) with the abundances for each site in rows (page 22). This sheet must start in the top left cell of that worksheet with only a single row of column labels. Make sure that you keep a reference file where you have recorded the specific identity of the unique species identifiers (e.g. A= Toyota Corolla, B= Leyland P76 etc.).\n\n\n3. Generating summary statistics for additional (univariate) analyses\nOn an additional spreadsheet/workspace, you should calculate summary statistics to perform additional univariate analyses. Create a copy of your completed excel file and or worksheet. You should generate a column in the far right of your spreadsheet summing the number of things in each row. You can then sort the data (REMEMBER TO SELECT IT ALL!) by that column and delete all the zero rows (i.e. no evidence of that species in your system).\nOwing to the high degree of variation and the number of singletons you will encounter it is possible (and likely) that some groups will pool species into more coarse groupings (i.e. “genera” or “family”).\nThe easiest way to calculate some of these summary statistics will be to use the pivot table command in Excel to sort your data for you. To do this:\n\nHighlight the dataset you want to use\nChoose Pivot Table from the Data menu\nWork through the wizard creating a pivot table in a new worksheet\nThen change the drop down menu in the box to “to data area” and click on the different sites to add them.\n\nYou should have a functional summary pivot table of your data. You can change the pivot tables to look at “counts” (equivalent of presence absence data) or “sums” (abundance data) for your spreadsheet.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Example of data sheet for importing data into SPSS for PCA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Example of data sheet for importing data into PRIMER",
