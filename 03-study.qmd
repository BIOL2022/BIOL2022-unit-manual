# How to study for BEDA {.unnumbered}

## Important tips

There's always something about statistics that makes it a bit more challenging than other subjects. But we believe that you can master our content with the right approach. Below are some helpful tips to help you study for this unit.

### 1. Keep up with lectures
Attend lectures in-person or watch the recordings as soon as possible. It is important to go through the material regularly and understand it before the practicals. This is especially important for those of you who have practicals on Tuesday afternoon, as the Lectures are in the morning.

### 2. Regular practice is key
Statistics requires regular practice. Make sure to allocate dedicated time to study and understand the concepts. Skipping content or cramming at the last minute will hinder your understanding and ability to apply the concepts to different scenarios. Remember, the material builds on itself, so it's important not to skip any lectures or content.

### 3. No question is silly

Don't hesitate to ask questions! There are multiple channels available for you to seek help and clarify any doubts you may have. You can ask questions during lectures, practicals, or in the Ed discussion forums. If you prefer anonymity/privacy, you can also ask questions anonymously on Ed or request a consultation with the lecturer. Additionally, Januar (your coordinator) holds weekly drop-in sessions where you can address any queries you may have.

### 4. Master the GLM

Module 1 covers the general linear model (GLM) approach to study design, which forms the basis of all the statistical tests in this unit. Understanding the GLM well will simplify the rationale behind all the statistics you learn. Modules 2 and 3 will build on this foundation, but only mention it briefly. **If you have a strong grasp of the GLM approach, you will find these modules much easier to understand.**

## Study plan

For BEDA, we recommend the following study plan:

- Lectures (or recordings): 2 hours per week
- Practical sessions: 2 hours per week
- Reading and understanding the content: minimum of 2 hours per week

For self-study, spend an hour after each lecture to revise the content and write your notes. Additionally, spend an hour at the end of the week to consolidate both the lectures and practicals.

### Assignments

The above excludes the time you will spend on assignments and preparing for the exams. We recommend that you **start your assignments early and not leave them to the last minute**. This will give you time to ask questions if you are stuck. 


### Cheatsheet

A cheatsheet section will be made available on the online version of this manual, updated weekly based on the questions you ask on Ed. This section will contain cheatsheets which will help you with data analysis.
