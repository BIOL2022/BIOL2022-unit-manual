# **Cheatsheets** {.unnumbered}


<!-- 
- Need to figure this section out.
- I will provide tidbit-sized cheatsheets on how to perform all sorts of stuff related to study design and data analysis in R, SPSS, Jamovi and JASP.
- Pick 2 to focus on for 2024:
  - R
  - SPSS
  - Jamovi
  - JASP
- The cheatsheets will be hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/usyd-soles-edu
- Can be used for other units (important)
- Preferable: supports version control
- Preferable: on a platform that is easy to use and update

Which platform?

Requirements:

- Can be proprietary but must be free for students
- Must produce at least an output that can be open-sourced:
  - txt or rtf instead of docx
  - md
  - html
- Hopefully *very* easy to use and edit.
- Possible:
  - Notion
  - Coda
  - Craft
  - GitHub Wiki
  - Canvas
  - Google Docs
