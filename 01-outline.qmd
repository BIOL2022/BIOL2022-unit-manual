# Outline {.unnumbered}

BEDA is "split" into **three modules**, each led by a different academic, from lectures to practicals. Because of this, you will notice that the delivery differs between modules, and some content may be *repeated*. **This is intentional**. We believe that **repetition is key** to learning some of the most important concepts in study design and statistics and some techniques need to be applied in different situations to be *fully* understood.

## Structure

- **Module 1, led by Januar Harianto, covers the fundamentals.** We expect most of you to be familiar with the basic statistical techniques, but we will go through them again to ensure everyone is on the same page. In addition we introduce to you the concept of study design and how it influences the results of your analysis. 
- **Module 2, led by Clare McArthur, critically assesses study designs through case studies.** Using real data examples, we will look at how variations in study design can influence the results. You *will* notice that the concepts from Module 1 are applicable to more *complex* models. You will also start working on Report 1 which requires you to design and analyse an experiment.
- **Module 3 is where we delve into multivariate designs.** You will learn to design experiments that look beyond pairwise comparisons and p-values, an increasingly popular dimension in the universe of statistics. You will also start on Report 2 which requires you to design and analyse a more complex experiment.

## Lectures and Labs

### Lectures
Lectures are **compulsory** and are held on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at different locations:

- **Tuesdays**: 10am-11am -- [The Quad General Lecture Theatre](https://venueweb.sydney.edu.au/A14.02.K2.05)
- **Wednesdays**: 10am-11am -- [Carslaw Lecture Theatre 159-259](https://venueweb.sydney.edu.au/F07.02.159-259)

### Labs
Labs are held on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays. You will be assigned to a lab and you **must** attend the lab session you are assigned to as attendance is recorded. Labs are also **compulsory** at either 2pm-4pm or 4pm-6pm. Check your timetable for your assigned lab time.

**All labs are held in [Carslaw Lab 307](https://venueweb.sydney.edu.au/F07.03.307).**

## Generative AI

There's no escaping generative AI (GenAI) -- so let's use it responsibly. In the first couple labs we will play around with some generative AI tools and discuss the implications of using them, including the ethical considerations.

In most cases we're happy for you to GenAI it **as long as you're transparent about it**, and that you are not using it to write your reports directly. Remember that you are here to learn and GenAI can be a useful tool to help you understand the concepts better, but using it to do your work defeats that  purpose. If you're unsure, ask us!

## What's next

The next section will detail **academic integrity**, **simple extension** and **special consideration**, which you may need to refer to throughout the semester.
