title: Week 1 -- Introduction
---

## Welcome
Welcome to the first practical of BEDA. We will use this time to introduce you to the software you will be using throughout the unit and also get you started on some modelling exercises.

**The only expectation for this practical is that you have attended the first lecture.** If you were not able to attend, please watch the recording before you come into the laboratory!

In Module 1, all practicals begin with a **workshop**. The workshop is a short class that goes through the key concepts of the week and may also include some resources for you to use in the practical. The workshop is followed by **exercises** that you will complete in the laboratory. The exercises are designed to help you understand the concepts covered in the lectures and gives you a chance to practice study design and data analysis.

Workshop slides are available on Canvas through the Weekly Lecture page.

### Workshop
In today's workshop we will go through:

- Getting to know one another
- Introduction to R, SPSS, Jamovi and JASP

The workshop should take no more than 30 minutes (**unless Januar talks too much ü§ê**). After the workshop, you will be given time to complete the exercises. 


## Exercise 1 -- cheatsheets

### Background
If you are new to statistical software like R or SPSS, don't worry! We will introduce you to **cheatsheets**, which are quick reference guides that help you remember important functions and commands. In this exercise you will pick from a list of cheatsheets and try to complete the analytical tasks provided. You can work in groups to discuss the cheatsheets, but try to complete them on your own.

### Work on part of a cheatsheet
1. In the **Cheatsheets** section, you will find a list of cheatsheets that have already been created for you. These cheatsheets are NOT complete and we will improve them as we go along.
2. **Choose a cheatsheet** that you would like to try out -- make sure it is something that you are *not* familiar with, as there is no point in trying out something that you already know from previous experience.
3. **Pick a section, or several,** on the cheatsheet and try to complete the tasks by following the steps. If you get stuck, don't worry! You can ask your peers or the demonstrators for help.

### Provide feedback 
Once you are done, you may provide feedback on the cheatsheets you have tried out. You can do this by submitting a comment on the form provided to you on Canvas. Your feedback will help us improve the cheatsheets for future students.


### Contribute to the cheatsheets
If you would like to take one step further and *contribute* to the cheatsheets, we are more than happy to accept your suggestions. You can do this in several ways:

- **Submit a pull request on GitHub.** You can find the link to the GitHub repository on the cheatsheet.
- **Submit a comment on Ed.** We will be monitoring the comments and will update the cheatsheets accordingly.
- **Email Januar with your suggestions.** This is absolutely fine!

If your changes are accepted, you will be credited and given co-authorship of the cheatsheet. Your work will be part of the unit's resources and will remain available for as long as BEDA exists. You can also refer to your contribution in your CV or portfolio!

Suggestions can be provided throughout the semester, so don't worry if you don't have time to contribute now. We will be updating the cheatsheets regularly.

## Exercise 2 -- introduction to models



### Background

One of the key aspects of study design is the ability to **model data**.  Of course, being the first practical of the unit we will not expect you do be able to do this perfectly (if at all). Instead, we will use this exercise to introduce you to the concept of **modelling data using graphical plots**, and to get you thinking about how you might use models to design and analyse your own studies.


### What is a model?

A model is a simplified representation of a complex system. In the context of data analysis, a model is a way to represent a dataset that allows us to shape testable hypotheses or make predictions about the data. Models can be simple or complex, depending on the data and the research question.

Eventually, you will be presenting what we call an **empirical model**, which looks like a mathematical equation, but actually does not really require *any* mathematical knowledge to understand.


An example of an empirical model is this:

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon$$

The above may look intimidating at first, but we can replace most of the symbols with words, and even hide the coefficients ($\beta$):

$$\text{height} = \text{weight} + \text{age}$$

### Plots as models

For now, we will focus on **graphical models**. These are *plots*, but essentially they "visually" represent a study design as they can summarise the results of a statistical model.

::: callout-tip
If you can **plot** it, you are already **modelling** it!

### What you will do

This exercise is designed to get you thinking about how to model data. You can consider how you would "model" the data and draw the plots on whiteboards or paper. Work in groups to discuss different modeling approaches. Here is an example:

1. Browse the possum data. Consider a model of how the **weight** of a possum changes with **age**.
2. Check the variables: weight is **numeric** and age is not -- it could be a **factor**.
3. Think of a study design involving 10 adults and 10 juveniles, comparing their mean weight.
4. Consider one of the following models:
    a. A **boxplot** of weight by age group
    b. A **scatterplot** of weight by age, which means age needs to be converted to a numeric variable (is it possible?)
5. Choose the most appropriate model and draw it on paper or whiteboard.

Notice that you have not actually done any data analysis yet! You are just thinking about how you would model the data. This is a crucial step in study design, as it helps you to think about what sort of data you need to collect and how you might analyse it.

::: callout-important
If you look at the data closely, there is only one juvenile possum in the dataset, but this is not a problem for this exercise. Your task is to think about how you would model the data, not to actually analyse it.
:::

If this does not make sense, consult your demonstrators for help. It's early days yet, so don't worry if you don't get it straight away!

### Do the following

Looking at the data provided, find data that will allow you to model, **by hand**, using the following:

- A histogram
- A scatterplot
- A boxplot
- Two boxplots side by side
- More than two barplots, side by side, *with or without error bars*

The above plots are often associated with specific empirical models, many of which we will cover over the next few weeks. Your demonstrators will be around to help you with this exercise and to check your ideas and plots.

::: callout-tip
- You are not expected to complete all the plots in one go. You can work on them after the practical.
- If you are new to plotting, **we expect you ask your peers and/or to look up resources online to help you with the plots**. Questions like: "What sort of model does a scatterplot often represent?" or "What is the difference between a histogram and a barplot?" are good starting points.

## End of practical

That's it for today! If you have any questions, please ask your demonstrators. They are here to help you. Remember to submit your feedback on the cheatsheets and to work on the exercises in your own time. We will see you next week for more study design and data analysis!
