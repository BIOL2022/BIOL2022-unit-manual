title: Week 1 -- Designing studies

## Welcome

Welcome to the first practical of BEDA. We will use this time to introduce you to the software you will be using throughout the unit and also get you started on some modelling exercises.

**The only expectation for this practical is that you have attended the first lecture.** If you were not able to attend, please watch the recording before you come into the laboratory!

## {{< fa chalkboard-teacher >}} Workshop

In today's workshop we will go through:

- Introduction to R, SPSS, Jamovi and JASP
- Generative AI use and misuse


## {{< fa tasks >}} Exercise 1 -- Cheatsheet

### Background
While BEDA is focused on the *practical* aspects of study design (see [Introduction](../index.qmd)), you will eventually need to analyse the data you collect.

As BEDA is software-agnostic let's spend some time in this practical to set up a **data analysis cheatsheet** for use throughout the unit.

A cheatsheet for BEDA is (ideally) a document that contains the following:

- The **software** you will be using for the course (ideally, stick to one or two software packages),
- a list of the **analyses** you will be performing, and
- a list of the **resources** you will be using to help you with the analyses, with **working examples** (we recommend the use of the `palmerpenguins` data for this purpose, but you can use any dataset you like).

Cheatsheets can be as simple or as complex as you like, but the idea is to develop a useful reference guide to help you as you progress. **Importantly you can start working on this cheatsheet now, and add to it as you progress.**

Example cheatsheets:

- [Data wrangling with `dplyr` and `tidyr` by Posit](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) - this one is specific to data manipulation in R, and you might design your own to be more general.
- [R for data science cheatsheet](https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1697642178/Marketing/Blog/R_Cheat_Sheet_PNG_1.pdf) by Datacamp - again, specific to R but a good example of a cheatsheet that covers a range of topics.
- [SPSS Cheat Sheet](https://ianadamsresearch.com/courses/pubpl-6002/spss-cheat/) by Ian T. Adams - An example of a text-only cheatsheet, without the bells and whistles, that covers a range of data manipulation and analysis techniques in SPSS.

**BUT WAIT! You're NOT the one making the cheatsheet!** Read the task below to understand exactly what you're doing.

## Exercise 2: Exploring models

### Data

In this exercise you will be focusing on

### Background

One of the key aspects of study design is the ability to **model data**.  Of course, being the first practical of the unit we will not expect you do be able to do this perfectly. Instead, we will use this exercise to introduce you to the concept of **modelling data using graphical plots**, and to get you thinking about how you might use models to design and analyse your own studies.


### What is a model?

A model is a simplified representation of a complex system. In the context of data analysis, a model is a way to represent a dataset that allows us to shape testable hypotheses or make predictions about the data. Models can be simple or complex, depending on the data and the research question.

Eventually, you will be presenting what we call an **empirical model**, which looks like a mathematical equation, but actually does not really require *any* mathematical knowledge to understand.


An example of an empirical model is this:

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon$$

The above may look intimidating at first, but we can replace most of the symbols with words, and even hide the coefficients ($\beta$):

$$\text{height} = \text{weight} + \text{age}$$


### Plots as models

For now, we will focus on **graphical models**. These are models that are represented visually, often as **plots**, and can help us to understand the relationships between variables in a dataset. It is also a way to explore the data before we start to analyse it, so we are really, killing two birds with one stone!
