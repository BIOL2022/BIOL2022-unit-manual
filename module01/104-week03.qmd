title: Week 3 -- Data analysis
---
## Welcome

In today's practical, we will focus on data analysis. You will work with your group to analyse the data you collected in the previous lab. Cheatsheets are available for you to use, and your demonstrators are ready to help. 

*You may need to clean your data before you can analyse it, so be prepared to spend some time on this.*

::: callout-important
You will be working in the same groups as **last week**. **If you were not present last week, join the group closest to you and work with them.**

## Learning objectives

By the end of this practical, you should be able to:

1. Fit a model to your data.
2. Check if the data meets the assumptions of the model.
3. Interpret the model output.
4. (optional) have working templates for different types of analyses that are GLM equivalents of the *t*-test, ANOVA and regression.

### What to submit at the end of the practical

**Your plot and model output**, on Google Drive. We will spend some time discussing the results at the end of the tutorial.
   

## Workshop

In today's workshop we will go through **general linear modelling** and **performing traditional statistics** in Jamovi and R. *The planned workshop on reproducible analyses in R and AI workflows will now be implemented as cheatsheets on a later date.* 

Workshop slides are available on Canvas.

## Lab activity

### [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vt91fyawYoYxv4xAkqFJMG-fFK-au5e7?usp=drive_link)

When ready, work with your group to analyse the data you collected in the previous lab using a **general linear model**. Click on the link above to access the data that you have collected.

You will need to:

- Fit your intended model to the data.
- Check if the data meets the assumptions of the model.
- Interpret the model output.

Of particular importance is the assessment of assumptions using residual plots, rather than formal tests of assumptions. 

**Your demonstrators are ready to help.** We expect you to be able to select the appropriate model to your data, but you can consult our cheatsheets and your demonstrators for help.

## If using Jamovi
Please install the GAMLj3 module in Jamovi. This will allow you to run general linear models in Jamovi with a lot of options:

1. Select the **Analyses** tab.
2. Click on the **Modules** button and select **jamovi library**.
3. In the Available tab, search for **GAMLj3** and click on the **INSTALL** button.

## Exercise 1 -- Preparing your data for analysis

Your data is available to download on Canvas. Please check that you have all the data you need before proceeding. You also have access to the data collected by other groups should you wish to practice your data analysis skills.

### Background

If you have followed study design principles, the data you have collected should be clean and ready for analysis. However, it is still a good idea to inspect your data further before proceeding with the analysis. This includes a check for:

- Missing data
- Outliers
- Data entry errors
- Assumptions of the statistical model, and whether the data meets them


### Missing data, outliers and data entry errors

These are what we sometimes call systematic errors. They can be detected by looking at the data and checking for unusual values, or cross-checking methods within your group. Make sure to remove or correct these errors before proceeding with the analysis.

## Exercise 2 -- Data analysis

### Fitting a model to data

Recall that you have an empirical model e.g. `y ~ x`. You will need to use an appropriate statistical model to fit this relationship to your data.

:::{.callout-note}
You should already know what model you are fitting to your data as it it part of your study design!
:::


### Checking assumptions

Assumptions need to be checked as they basically tell you whether the model you have fitted is appropriate for your data. If the assumptions are not met, you may need to transform your data or use a different model.

Common assumptions include:

- Normality (of residuals)
- Homogeneity of variance
- Independence of observations

**We recommend looking at residual plots**, rather than formal tests of assumptions. Formal tests of assumptions can be overly sensitive to large sample sizes and can lead to you rejecting a model that is actually appropriate for your data.

**What to do if assumptions are not met?** This is a common problem in data analysis, and interestingly, it is not always a problem. Provided that you have ensured that your data is representative of the population you are interested in, violations of normality can actually be ignored in many cases, **although you should still report them**. A larger problem is homogeneity of variance.


Nevertheless, you get to decide on what to do here to avoid violation of assumptions. The first step would be to try and transform your data. If this does not work, you will need to use a different model or a non-parametric equivalent of the model you are using.

### Statistical testing

Running the statistical test is probably the *least* eventful part of the analytical workflow and will take you a few seconds regardless of the software you are using, especially if you are running GLMs. Make sure that you record the software used and the specific statistical technique selected such that the analysis is **reproducible**.


### Interpretation

Interpreting the output of a statistical test is a skill that takes time to develop. You will need to be able to:

- Understand the important parts of the output e.g. F-statistic, p-value, degrees of freedom, etc.
- Explain what the output means in the context of your data.
- Explain what the output means in the context of your research question.

Your lectures and this week's workshop will help you develop these skills.

Your data may not be interpretable due to the way it was collected. This is ok -- a lesson learnt. You can still discuss the issues with the data and what you would do differently next time. Meanwhile, you can still practice your data analysis skills on your data (or download another group's data).


## Exercise 3 -- putting it all together


The general linear modelling framework is incredibly intuitive for building statistical models. Use the datasets below to repeat Exercises 1 and 2. Some hints:

- Try to add more than one predictor to your model and see how the output changes. 
- Use your understanding of data structure to determine if you have set your model up correctly -- i.e. is that variable really numeric?
- The data may need to be cleaned before you can analyse it. This is a good opportunity to practice your data cleaning skills.

::: callout-note
On top of what you have been taught so far (linear regression and *t*-test), you will most likely create models that are equivalent to Analysis of Variance, Multiple Linear Regression and Analysis of Covariance techniques. These will be touched on in the next few weeks but you can get a head start now -- that's the beauty of GLMs!

#### Weight data for domestic cats

Handy hints:

- Read the metadata if you are unsure what the variables mean.
- You can look at the relationships between the continuous variables for each gender of cat. Is there a way to combine these relationships into one model?
- Can Sex be used as a response variable in this model? *You don't have to do this, but it is an interesting question to consider.*

#### Cherry trees

Handy hints:

- This dataset seems very simple and should be easy to analyse... or is it?
- Use what you have learnt about simple linear regression and add more predictors to your model!
- Think about the assumptions of the model and whether they are met. Do you need to alter your interpretation of these diagnostic plots in any way?

#### Effects of dietary protein on pigs

Handy hints:

- This dataset is messy and may need to be tidied up before you can analyse it.
 - Think of how the idea of a *t*-test, which compares two groups, can be extended to this dataset where you are comparing multiple groups. Does this change the way you need to set up your model?
 - Are you brave enough to look for interactions between variables?

#### Sugar cane disease data

Handy hints:

- This dataset is a bit more complex than the others. You may need to spend some time understanding the variables before you can analyse the data.
- You do not need to use all the variables in your analysis. There are two possible response variables in this dataset - you can choose which one to use.

## Submit your results

Once complete, please upload your results to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vt91fyawYoYxv4xAkqFJMG-fFK-au5e7?usp=drive_link) for archival. If there's time, we will discuss the results together.

## End

That's it. Module 1 practicals are now complete. I hope you have learnt a few things about experimental design and data analysis. We will continue to build on these skills in the next module using real-world data.
