Welcome to Biology Experimental Design and analysis, also known as **BEDA**. This book contains all of the information you need to navigate your way around the practicals for this unit. It also contains some additional 'housekeeping' information that you may find useful.

Many students think of BEDA as *yet another statistics unit*. This is not quite true. Unlike most other statistical units, BEDA focuses on the **practical** aspects of data analysis. We assume that you already have a basic understanding of statistical concepts, and we build on that knowledge, focusing on the **how** and **why** of statistical methods:

- *How* do we design a good study?
- *Why* does study design make a difference in the results we get?
- *Why* is it important to understand the context in which we use statistical tests?

Importantly, **attending labs is crucial to your learning** as most of the data we use are collected by **you** -- please do not skip any of them! 

Please read all the sections before the practicals as they contain important housekeeping information.
