One skill that helps me do so, is knowing how to set up an experiment to test my ideas about the world. You may need to overcome that initial learning hump, but if you persist, you will have a skill at your fingertips that will stand you in really good stead for the future. It does *not* matter whether you intend to go on in research or not -- knowing what makes good research and good evidence is important in so many walks of life. \n\nMy message is: whether you are doing this unit just because you have to, or because you are interested -- take heart! I never did anything more complicated than a t-test even during my PhD – but now I LOVE designing experiments and grappling with data. It can be frustrating at first, especially if you are time-poor and just want to get the job done. It can be infuriating. It can also be fun (yes -- fun!). Most of all it’s incredibly satisfying and extraordinarily useful. \n\nSo, persist, try your best, and ask for help if you need it.\n\n**Please remember we want you to learn this stuff. No question you ask is *EVER* silly!** So ask for help any time.\n\nWe *do* expect you to have a go at telling us what you think the answer is. This helps us understand what you get and what you don’t get, and so helps us help you.\nWe don’t judge you by the questions you ask, but by what you end up learning. \n\n## About this Module\n\nIn **Module 1**, you have learnt the principles for converting a biological observation or question of interest into practice. Here, you will build on this skill. You will sign up to a research project and go through the process of converting a biological idea into a research experiment, which you and your group will then do from start to finish, to answer it. **You must draw on all the lectures we present to you in this unit, so attend your lectures of view them as soon as they are available. You will need to use the information immediately in these pracs.** You will use your knowledge and experience to design your project, collect the data, and analyse and interpret it appropriately. \n\n## What you need to submit for this practical component\nThis assessment requires two separate submissions in Canvas:\n\n1.\tThe Excel file (spreadsheets) containing your Group’s data. This needs to be submitted by one group member on behalf of your group. \n2.\tYour Individual Report on your experiment, in the format of a short scientific article (worth 25% of the total unit mark). \n\n## How you will get feedback \n- You will receive informative, but not exhaustive, feedback on your report in relation to the marking matrix. This will show what you achieved against each criterion, and why. \n- To help you understand how you could improve, it helps enormously if you make a conscious effort to compare your submitted work against others. To facilitate this, I will post the best report written for your particular project. \n- Should you want feedback beyond this, please reflect on your report and write a summary of how your report compares to the best one, addressing each of the marking criteria. Once you’ve done that, please email me to request an appointment, attaching your summary to the email message. BUT please note that because of the large class size, I may not be able to meet with everyone who wants to. As I am sure you will appreciate, I will give priority to any students with low/fail marks. \n\n\n\\newpage\n\\KOMAoptions{paper=landscape,pagesize}\n\\recalctypearea\n\n## Timeline\n\n\n\n\n\n:::

Pick up any gear that you need, to run your pilot study. |- **Form your hypothesis**: as a group, convert the general biological question into specific biological hypotheses and predictions.\n- Plan the design of your main experiment: \nwith your group, design a simple experiment to test the hypothesis. Ensure your design can be analysed using the stats you are familiar with (e.g. from Januar’s and Clare’s lectures, and Module 1 Pracs).\nDraw a graph of how you expect your data to look (refer to Clare’s lectures). Decide what stats analysis is appropriate and why (refer to Clare’s lectures). If you can’t work this out, you are not ready to run your experiment.\n- Draft your data sheets: as a group, draft your data sheets for data collection (you may need to modify after your pilot study). This will ensure you collect all the data you should, and collect it all in the same way. \n- Work out what equipment you’ll need: decide equipment you need to do the research based around what we can supply you. Consult Clare, technical staff and/or demonstrators then make a list. \nFor some projects, you will be able to take gear home straight away to run a pilot study. \nFor others, you need to plan now and pick up gear in consultation with the technical staff. When contacting the tech staff, ensure you state your name and day, group number and project, e.g. BIOL2022 WED 2 to 4pm, Group 7 birds, Joe Blogs.\n\n**Plan your pilot study in class and run it before Week 5 Prac Session: this will help you refine your main experiment.** Everyone in your group must contribute. |NA   |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\newpage\n\\KOMAoptions{paper=portrait,pagesize}\n\\recalctypearea",
