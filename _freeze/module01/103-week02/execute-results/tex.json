Today we will be focusing on data collection and how to prepare your data for analysis.\n\n## Workshop\nThe Week 2 workshop will go through the following:\n\n- Tidy data principles\n- Applying models (an R example)\n\nWorkshop slides are available on Canvas through the Weekly Lecture page.\n\n## Exercise 1 -- Modelling from observations\n\n### Background\nImages are commonly used to quantify patterns in biology, from molecules to ecosystems. In ecology, for instance, satellite images and aerial photographs are used in some ecological studies to quantify patterns of distribution and abundances of animals and plants across habitats. \n\nHere you will explore experimental design, model formulation and data analysis by collecting data from available images and use both evidence and logic to work out how to explain the patterns you observe.\n\n\n### Work in groups\nYou will be working in groups of 3-4 students. Your task is to **observe** the images provided and formulate a **model** that explains the patterns you observe. You will then create a **study design** that will allow you to test your model. \n\n::: callout-important\n**Do not proceed to Exercise 2 until you have completed this exercise, and a Demonstrator has accepted your study design.**\n:::\n\n### Getting started\n\nYou are provided with random, representative, replicate photographs of a common marine habitat that spans > 8,000 km of the Great Southern Reef, i.e. the coastline along the bottom half of Australia -- intertidal rocky shores (Fig 1). \n\n![Fig 1. The Great Southern Reef. © 2021 California Academy of Sciences.](../assets/southern-reef-map.png){width=70%}\n\nAccess the images, including background information, [here](/module01/105-images.qmd){target=\"_blank\"} (note: link will open in a new window/tab).\n\n**Using these images and the species identification guide, formulate a model and a (testable) hypothesis. You will then think about what data you need to collect to test your hypothesis.** See below for further details.\n\n\n\n### Study design\n\nYou should have a clear model in mind before collecting data. The model determines your sampling strategy and the type of data you need. Consider the following:\n\n- **What is the purpose of your model?** Think about the biological question you are trying to answer, and the kinds of data you need to collect to answer it.\n- Think of how you would collect data to test your model. **What are the variables you need to measure?** How would you measure them?\n- Scrutinise your images with the model in mind. **Can the data be collected representatively from the images?** Are there issues of replication or confounding variables that you need to consider?\n- Do you have the time and resources to complete the study in the time frame provided, i.e. by the end of next week?\n- What is your **backup plan** if data assumptions are not met? \n\nWhile you may not have all the answers right away, it's important to have a rough idea of what you want to do, such as comparing groups, measuring correlation, or creating a linear model.\n\n#### Prepare the following information for your Demonstrator:\n\n1. **Model and hypothesis**: What is your model and hypothesis? What are you trying to test?\n2. **Variables**: What are the variables you need to measure? What types of variables are they (e.g. continuous, categorical)?\n3. **Data collection**: How would you collect data to test your model? What are the potential issues you need to consider? \n\n## Exercise 2 -- data entry\n\n\n\nEnter your data into a spreadsheet as soon as you have them. You can use any spreadsheet software you like (e.g. Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers). Google Sheets is easiest if everyone in your group is sampling and entering data at the same time as it is easy to set up a shared spreadsheet.\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n## Discuss\nIf more than one person is entering data, will it influence the results? Why or why not? Think about how you can reduce the impact of this.\n:::\n\nTo make your life easier, *try* to follow [tidy data principles](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html):\n\n1. Each variable must have its own column.\n2. Each observation must have its own row.\n3. Each value must have its own cell. \n\nThe table below is tidy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{longtable}{llr}\n\\toprule\nperson & treatment & count \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nJohn & A & 5 \\\\ \nMary & A & 3 \\\\ \nJane & A & 2 \\\\ \nJohn & B & 6 \\\\ \nMary & B & 4 \\\\ \nJane & B & 5 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below is not (although it may look \"better” to you):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{longtable}{lrr}\n\\toprule\nperson & treatment A & treatment B \\\\ \n\\midrule\\addlinespace[2.5pt]\nJohn & 5 & 6 \\\\ \nMary & 3 & 4 \\\\ \nJane & 2 & 5 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy data will reduce the amount of time you spend cleaning your data, but if you find it cumbersome, you can still collect data in your own way, and fix them later.\n\n## End of practical\n\nPlease make sure that you have completed Exercise 1 before leaving the practical. Hopefully you would also have collected some data, but if not,\nExercise 2 can be completed either at home or next week during the practical.\n\n",
