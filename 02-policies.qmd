## Academic integrity 

All students are expected to be familiar and act in compliance with the relevant University policies, procedures and codes. These include the following:

- [Academic Integrity Policy (pdf)](https://www.sydney.edu.au/policies/showdoc.aspx?recnum=PDOC2012/254&RendNum=0)
- [Academic Integrity Procedures (pdf)](https://www.sydney.edu.au/policies/showdoc.aspx?recnum=PDOC2012/255&RendNum=0)
- [The Student Charter](https://www.sydney.edu.au/policies/showdoc.aspx?recnum=PDOC2011/215&RendNum=0)
- [Student Responsibilities](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/student-responsibilities.html)
- [University of Sydney (Student Discipline) Rule (pdf)](https://www.sydney.edu.au/policies/showdoc.aspx?recnum=PDOC2017/441&RendNum=0)


Below are the types of academic integrity breaches that are monitored and enforced by the University, which students should be aware of:

1. **Recycling**: Resubmitting work that is the same or substantially similar to work previously submitted for assessment without permission.
2. **Plagiarism**: Presenting another person's work as one's own without appropriate acknowledgment of the source. This includes using phrases, sentences, or longer extracts from published or unpublished work without proper attribution.
3. **Collusion**: Presenting work as independent when it has been produced in whole or part with others, and with the knowledge of the parties involved.
4. **Contract cheating**: Engaging in various forms of outsourcing work to third parties, such as having someone else complete an assessment, purchasing completed assessments, or submitting work generated by artificial intelligence without permission.
5. **Exam cheating**: Attempting to gain an unfair advantage in an exam through prohibited materials, communicating with others, copying, or using electronic devices inappropriately.

Other breaches include fabricating data, inappropriately sharing assessments online, and using digital tools like paraphrasing software to disguise plagiarism or contract cheating.
The severity of these breaches is determined by factors like the student's level of study, prior academic integrity breaches, and the extent and type of the breach. Breaches are classified as minor, major, or student misconduct, each carrying different penalties.


## Simple extensions

Simple extensions are intended as an informal, streamlined way for students to get short extensions for legitimate reasons, without impacting their special consideration rights for more significant circumstances. According to the [Coursework Policy 2021](https://www.sydney.edu.au/policies/showdoc.aspx?recnum=PDOC2014/378&RendNum=0):

The special considerations unit may permit a student to submit an assignment task **up to five calendar days** after the due date with **no penalty** on certain grounds, including:

  - illness;
  - injury;
  - misadventure;
  - death of relative, close personal friend or pet; and
  - carer responsibilities.

Simple extension must be applied for **before the due date** of the assessment task. **The student must apply for the extension through the [Special Consideration and Arrangements portal](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/special-consideration.html).** 

::: callout-important
Simple extensions are **not** applicable under the following circumstances:

- Group work assignments; 
- where the assignment release time is 10 working days or less;
- paid or volunteer employment;
- clash with other assessments i.e. balancing workload;
- computer/software malfunctions, unless it could not be prevented.
:::


Students needing an extension **exceeding five calendar days** can apply through the special consideration portal with necessary documentation. For details, see below.


## Special consideration 

For more significant, longer-term impacts that are not sufficiently addressed by simple extension, students may apply for special consideration due to the following (clause 82):

- **Attendance at a funeral** of a family member or close friend.
- **Death** of a family member or close friend.
- **Illness** or **injury**.
- **Misadventure**.
- **Technology-related problem** which **could not** have been prevented, avoided, or minimised by your reasonable diligence, e.g. an extended power failure due to a storm.

Each of the above reasons **must** be supported by appropriate documentation, outlined under [Eligibility](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/special-consideration.html#eligibility) in the special consideration Portal.

All applications for special consideration should be submitted **no later than 3 working days after the due date or examination date**, although late applications may be considered in exceptional circumstances.
Applications for special consideration should be submitted via the [Special Consideration and Arrangements portal](https://www.sydney.edu.au/students/special-consideration.html) on the course website.

**Special consideration is not guaranteed and may result in alternative outcomes like alternative assessments or adjusted assessment weightings.**
